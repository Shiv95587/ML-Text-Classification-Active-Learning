# ML TC Active Learning

## Overview

The ML TC Active Learning project enhances text classification performance using active learning techniques combined with Support Vector Machines (SVM). It improves classification efficiency by selecting the most informative samples for labeling, optimizing model performance and resource utilization.

## Features

- **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** Utilizes SVM for robust text classification, effective with high-dimensional data.
- **Active Learning:** Implements active learning to iteratively select and label the most informative samples, reducing extensive data labeling needs and improving accuracy.
- **Scikit-learn Integration:** Uses Scikit-learn for SVM and active learning, enabling easy experimentation and fine-tuning.

## Key Components

- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes text data preprocessing and feature extraction to prepare the dataset for classification.
- **Model Training:** Trains the SVM model using active learning techniques to enhance performance.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Provides metrics to evaluate model performance and the effectiveness of the active learning strategy.
